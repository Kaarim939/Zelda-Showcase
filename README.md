# Pitch

The goal here was to create a simple showcase website for the game The Legend of the Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.  
I've used some pretty uncommon library which I had already used in my previous projects as Leaflet for the world map or ThreeJs Fiber for the 3D models.

The web site is fully responsive.

ALL the assets are from the original game or the original website.  
As it's only an showcase website, I've decided to not use protection for the assets.  
The website is not fully finished, ( the story section and footer is missing, as other little things like the markers on the map).
